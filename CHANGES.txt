V3.1.18
  - Model workflow able to generate correct (coordinates of a model) and failed (meshes whose model workflow failed
    and need to be fixed).
  - Viewer adapted to this new scenario.
  - The generation of the saving yes/no dialog window was adapted to the new scenario, too
V3.1.17
  - Fix test
  - Dynamo version check message rewritten
V3.1.16
  - Alignment improvement: if dynamo fails, alignStep does not finish
V3.1.15
  - Protocol for importing subtomograms from Dynamo's .tbl files improved.
  - Binning factor interpretation is now the same as in IMOD (followed by Scipion).
  - Protocol for subtomograms alignment simplified.
  * For developers:
    - Tests expanded and re-factorized using the test centralization layer.
    - Protocols for tomograms importing and subtomograms subboxing disabled (to be reviewed).
V3.1.14
  - Hotfix
V3.1.13
  - Protocol for averaging subtomograms added.
  - Boxing protocol improved to be able to work with multiple types of models and generate an adapted
    output depending on if the user carried out the model workflow from Dynamo's boxing GUI or not.
  - As a viewer, Dynamo is launched faster, with only one call to MATLAB no matter if the current protocol
    is a Dynamo project or not.
  - In both the boxing protocol and the viewer, the message box to ask the user to save the changes made or not
    appears only if new data was generated instead of always.
  - Message box push button label changed from Cancel to Close, for coherence.
  - Model Workflow protocol simplified in terms of GUI parameters and improved to make it able to work with different
    model types, and also adapt the general models detected to surfaces to provide a mesh.
V3.1.12
  - Dynamo's alignment step call .exe file to get output "on the fly"
V3.1.11
  - Dynamo alignment significantly refactored:
       many params allow specification of round like "360 180 90". Labeled with (R)
       Protocol convert creates de catalog and templates and so on but processing params are moved to alignStep
       alignStep is resumable, but not yet from a specific iteration (TODO)
V3.1.10
20-January-2023.  - Fixing an error in the import subtomograms test
                  - Updating README.txt
